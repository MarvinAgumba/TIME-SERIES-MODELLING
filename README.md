# <p>PREDICTING COUNTRY'S GDP USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS<p>

This repository shall host my final phase 5 project where we shall be analyzing & forecasting GDP trends (Case study Kenya - Finance Bill Reaction).\
Kenyan Parliament recently, on the 26th of June 2023, passed to law the contentious Finance Bill 2023 proposing a raft of tax policy measures that aim to yield additional revenue and explore more effective measures to enhance the Country's revenue collection.\
The Government feels the ratio of tax revenue as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) being well below acceptable levels to enable spur economic growth & reduce the cost of living in the long term. (***According to the World Bank, tax revenues above 15% of a countryâ€™s GDP are a key ingredient for economic growth and, ultimately, poverty reduction***)
