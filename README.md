<p># PREDICTING COUNTRY'S GDP USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS<p>

This project comes out as part of the work done in my Master thesis. Here ML algorithms are used - using World Bank data - to obtain models with higher performance - measured in MAE and MSE - than standard econometric models - such as those used by the IMF. Years 2002 to 2021 are selected.
