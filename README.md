# <p>PREDICTING COUNTRY'S GDP USING MACHINE LEARNING ALGORITHMS<p>

This repository shall host my final phase 5 project where we shall be analyzing & forecasting GDP trends (Case study Kenya - Finance Bill Reaction).\
Kenyan Parliament recently, on the 26th of June 2023, passed to law the contentious Finance Bill 2023 proposing a raft of tax policy measures that aim to yield additional revenue and explore more effective measures to enhance the Country's revenue collection.\
The Government feels the ratio of tax revenue as a percentage of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) being well below acceptable levels to enable spur economic growth & reduce the cost of living in the long term. (***According to the World Bank, tax revenues above 15% of a countryâ€™s GDP are a key ingredient for economic growth and, ultimately, poverty reduction***)

## <p>BUSINESS UNDERSTANDING<p>

**This project shall aim to analyze the Country's historical GDP trends and forecast future GDP growth. The analysis shall assist provide insights into economic growth patterns, identify emerging trends, and support evidence-based decision-making for various stakeholders.**

## <p>PROJECT OVERVIEW<p>

The following steps were taken into consideration:
- **Data Understanding**: Processes involved: Loading dataset generated from the world bank website; Bivariate/Multivariate analysis;
- **Data Preparation***: Data cleaning; Removing Duplicates; Dealing with missing values; Stationarity Check; Feature Importances
- **Data Visualization**:
- **Modelling**: Plot ACF/PACF plots, AR, ARIMA & SARIMA Models, Testing accuracy (MSE & MAE scores)
- **Model Evaluation, Prediction & Forecating**

## <p>SOME IMPORTANT VISUALIZATIONS<p>
